ThreeJS-EffectComposer
======================

#### UMD Ports of the Three JS Effects Composer to facilitate inclusion through [Bower](http://bower.io/)

The purpose of the library is to enable a more modern work flow for web sites that feature [three.js](http://threejs.org/) and want to use one of the allready developed Effects Composer; Using Bower to manage your controls as a component, instead of having to have scripts loose in the top of html. 

- This library does not include all the post processing files, only the ones that the Main Effects Composer file is dependant on. As I do more Three js work and exploration I will update this repository with the remaining files.
